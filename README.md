# Kopano OL Extension
We live in a world where it is a commodity to work with apps or web interfaces â€“ just have a look at the big amounts of HTML5-apps on your tablets and smartphones. However, there are situations in which a rich application is needed. Think about working offline during a five hour flight or deeper integrations like writing series of letters in your Office suite.

This is exactly why we developed the Kopano Outlook Extension (KOE). If you are on the road a lot and thus without an internet connection, or if you rely heavily on specialised plugins in Outlook, then the Kopano OL Extension might just be the thing for you.
